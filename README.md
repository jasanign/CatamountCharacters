# CatamountCharacters

The main purpose of the application is to facilitate the selection and display of one or two full screen letters using the Intermural font, the WCU catamount logo or the alumni tower logo. The intention is that multiple Android devices can be placed side by side to spell out messages that can be read at a moderate distance.
